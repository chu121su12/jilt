Bugs
----
- figure out what happens when the target class is generic
- figure out the crash when running `gradle build` instead of `gradle clean build`

Future
------
- add a `@Builder.generateGetters` attribute
- enable Builder generation without source modifications (Builder(s)For annotations)
- add the generation date to the @Generated annotation

Possibly
--------
? split the project into 2 Gradle subprojects
? check the required (non-optional) properties in classic Builder as well
? what about inheriting from the Builder class?
