Bugs
----
- figure out what happens when the target class is generic
- figure out the crash when running `gradle build` instead of `gradle clean build`

Future
------
- add a `@Builder.generateGetters` attribute
- enable Builder generation without source modifications (Builder(s)For annotations)
- add the generation date to the @Generated annotation

Possibly
--------
? split the project into 2 Gradle subprojects
? check the required (non-optional) properties in classic Builder as well
? `@Builder.enclosingInterface` attribute?
? what about inheriting from the Builder class?

Competition
-----------
- PojoBuilder (https://github.com/mkarneim/pojobuilder)
    - weird behavior for constructor & method annotations (still scans the class for properties)
    - doesn't have a notion of optional properties
    - bad behavior for class annotation (uses no-arg constructors + setters)
    - no type-safe Builder support
- Jackdaw (https://github.com/vbauer/jackdaw) - for Android
- Immutables
- Google AutoCode
- Google FreeBuilder
